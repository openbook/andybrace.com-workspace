# About me

<Section>
    <Heading tag='h2' className='subheading h5' text='Ways of working' />

    <Heading tag='h3' className='subheading h6' text='Scope' />
    <p>Technical discoveries identify team capabilities and constraints, and this is something I do by conducting interviews with technical stakeholders and desk research.</p> 
    <Heading tag='h3' className='subheading h6' text='Plan' />
    <p>I like planning projects around user stories, product backlogs and keeping delivery cycles short.  There are many tools that help to do that, I'm most used to JIRA and Trello.</p>
