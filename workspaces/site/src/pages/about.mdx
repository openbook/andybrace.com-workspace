    <p>Before any project starts it important to conduct a technical discovery.  Technical discoveries identify team capabilities and constraints. With this information you can understand how to achieve a project.  I do this by conducting interviews with technical stakeholders and desk research.</p> 
    <Heading tag='h3' className='subheading h6' text='Plan' />
    <p>I plan projects around user stories.  I'm used to creating, reviewing and expanding on user stories within product backlogs.  There are many tools that help to do that, i'm most used to JIRA and Trello.</p>

    <p>I enjoy working in cross functional teams, and especially those working in 'sprints'.  Quick delivery cycles means collaboration is important.  I'm happy <a target="_blank" href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2017/09/04/the-benefits-of-coding-in-the-open/">coding in the open</a>, and getting / giving feedback via code review.  I use tools like Docker, Github to help collaboration.</p>
