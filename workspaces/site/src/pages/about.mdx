# About me
I've been building digital products in the education and charity sectors since 2006.  I enjoy working in cross functional teams that employ <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery">agile delivery methods</a> to build user focussed products.

    <Heading tag='h3' className='subheading h6' text='Scope' />
    <p>I conduct <a href="https://technology.blog.gov.uk/2016/02/08/the-role-of-an-architect-in-discovery/">technical discoveries</a> via interviews with technical stakeholders and desk research to identify a team's capabilities and constraints.</p> 
    <Heading tag='h3' className='subheading h6' text='Plan' />
    <p>Projects planned around <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research/understanding-users-who-dont-use-digital-services">user personas and stories</a> maintain a better focus on whats really needed from a product.  I'm used to building and maintaining these stories from project start to finish.</p>
    <Heading tag='h3' className='subheading h6' text='Prototype' />
    <p>I value sketching, prototyping and whiteboarding ideas before any code is written.  This helps to start conversations within a team and to arrive at a better solution.</p>
    <Heading tag='h3' className='subheading h6' text='Deliver' />
    <p>Quick delivery cycles means collaboration & code quality is important.  I'm happy <a target="_blank" href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2017/09/04/the-benefits-of-coding-in-the-open/">coding in the open</a>, and receiving & giving regular feedback.  I work with tools like Docker and AWS to allow for faster & more scalable deployments.</p>
