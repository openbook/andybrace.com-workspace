# About me
I am a senior full stack developer with over 12 years experience delivering products in the education & NGO sectors. Iâ€™ve led cross functional development teams throughout the agile lifecycle for clients like British Council, Cancer Research, Save the Children & Public Health England.

Using my experience of rapid prototyping, iterative development and regular user feedback I am able to help clients embrace <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery">agile and lean principles</a> to build solutions that provide the most value to users.

    <p>Projects planned around <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research/understanding-users-who-dont-use-digital-services">user personas and stories</a> maintain a better focus on whats really needed from a product.

    <Heading tag='h3' className='subheading h6' text='Prototype' />
    <p>I value sketching, prototyping and whiteboarding ideas before any code is written.  This helps to start conversations within a team and to arrive at a better solution.</p>

    <p>Quick delivery cycles means collaboration & code quality is important.  I'm happy <a target="_blank" href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2017/09/04/the-benefits-of-coding-in-the-open/">coding in the open</a>, and receiving & giving regular feedback.
