Promonews is the industry go-to blog for daily music video releases.  I'm responsible for all things technical at Promonews and its a company ive worked with since 2011.  

I've overseen 2 rebuilds in that time.  The current version delivers a progressive web experience via a universal client & server rendered React app. The content is managed via a Drupal 7 admin area & updates are pushed to ElasticSearch, which provides the RESTful API for the frontend.  This setup supports easy content management & allows users to filter and find the content they want.
