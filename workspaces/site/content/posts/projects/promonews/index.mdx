Promonews is the industry go-to blog for daily music video releases.  I'm responsible for all things technical at Promonews and its a company ive worked with since 2011.  

I've overseen 2 rebuilds in that time.  The current incarnation uses server and client side rendered React.js on the frontend.  This helps provide a modern progressive web experience.  Content is managed using Drupal 7.  Updates are then pushed to ElasticSearch, which provides the RESTful API for the frontend.  This setup supports easy content management & allows users to filter and find the content they want.
