Should I Bake is a single page web app that aims to help users make a better informed choice about when they should bake depending on the amount of renewable energy that is being generated.  The eventual idea being to
help encourage small lifestyle changes based on energy consumption.

Working with Mike Fell and Ed Sharp from the Bartlet Institute for Energy at UCL, I helped take the concept from the idea stage, through definition of user personas and their prioritised
stories, to delivery and deployment.  We're currently on the third iteration of this concept and have based our changes on the valuable feedback we've received along the way.
