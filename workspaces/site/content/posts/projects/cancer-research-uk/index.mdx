My role at Cancer Research initially involved supporting their main site migration to a Drupal CMS.  As part of this, I mentored their in house development team & supported their deployments on to the managed Acquia hosting platform.  As CRUK grew their digital department, I moved into a lead developer role in one of what was then 2 scrum teams, expanding upon the work we'd done with the CMS to deliver a brand new site for the Stand up to Cancer campaign & a new registration platform for CRUK sporting events.

I also played a significant role in the delivery of the updated Race for Life platform in 2017 which saw the charity migrate away from a legacy system on to several connected digital services.  In my role I helped architect the digital data flow & lead a team of mainly contracted developers in the events registration product.
